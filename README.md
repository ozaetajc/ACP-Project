# Text-Based turn Game

We made a text based game in Python. 

Methods used: While loops, If ,else, elif statements, the 
creation of a class to allow for Object Oriented Programming. 

A Player has 3 different choices, a normal attack, burst attack and healing (regeneration), the aim of 
the game is to beat the enemy computer by getting the opposition to 0 health.

(We used pygame.mixer in pygame instead of playsound to import audio, because we wanted to keep the background music playing while other audio plays throughout the course of it.)

Required:

• Python 3.10.0

• pygame
